### Introduction

This repository contains the **Basketball Strategy Simulator**, developed as part of a software engineering course project. The goal of this software is to create a strategic flowchart in **GIFA** format for basketball games, providing a clear plan for offensive and defensive strategies for both teams. This simulator can be expanded to include other sports based on user needs.

### System Requirements

- **Development Environment**: Eclipse IDE (JDK 17)
- **Operating System**: Windows

### Features

- **Basketball Panel**: A visual representation of the court, with 10 players (5 for each team) and a basketball. Players and the ball can be dragged to any position on the court.
- **Tool Bar**:
    - New Project: Create a new project.
    - Export Project: Export the flowchart as a GIFA file.
    - Save/Load: Save or load the player and ball positions for easy continuation of the project.
    - Full Screen Mode: Toggle full-screen view.
- **Operational Panel**:
    - Draw shapes: Draw lines, circles, arrows, and more on the basketball court.
    - Eraser: Remove any added shapes or text.
    - Text Box: Add text labels to different parts of the strategy.
    - Color Picker: Choose colors for drawings and shapes.
    - Undo/Redo: Navigate through previous actions.
- **Multi-Page Flowcharts**: Easily create multi-page diagrams to plan different phases of the strategy.

### Usage

1. Run the project through **Eclipse IDE**.
2. Use the **Basketball Panel** to position players and create strategies.
3. Save or export your strategy in **GIFA format** for future reference or to share with the team.

### Future Development

- Plans to expand the simulator to support additional sports.
- Further optimization and new features based on user feedback.
